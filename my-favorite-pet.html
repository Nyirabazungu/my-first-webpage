            <li>Dog</li>
            <p>Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various 
                behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Modern 
                dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than 
                any other domestic animal. Dogs are predators and scavengers,the dog has powerful muscles, fused
                 wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, 
                 and teeth for catching and tearing. </p>
            <li>Cat</li>
            <p>he domestic cat is a complex creature and unfortunately problems can arise for cats 
                because sometimes we do not understand their natural drives and reactions. 
                Understanding what kind of environment they prefer to occupy, their social structure, 
                feeding patterns and even toilet habits can influence decisions made about their care 
                that have a significant benefit to their quality of life</p>
