        <h3>My favorite friends</h3>
        <p>They are <em>my Friends</em> from WECODE</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>A friend </strong>is a person who is willing to take me the way I am.” Accepting this as one definition of the word, may I quickly suggest that we are something 
            less than a real friend if we leave a person the same way we find him.</p>

            <strong><li>Meat</li></strong>
            <p>Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food.
                 Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times.
                  The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, 
                  sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle. This eventually led to their use in meat production
                   on an industrial scale with the aid of slaughterhouses</p>
                <strong><li>Rice</li></strong>
            <p>Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or
                 Oryza glaberrima (African rice). As a cereal grain, 
                 it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of
                  the world's human population, especially in Asia.
                   It is the agricultural commodity with the 
                   third-highest worldwide production (rice, 741.5 million tonnes in 2014), 
                   after sugarcane (1.9 billion tonnes) and
                   maize (1.0 billion tonnes).</p>
            <strong><li>Pizza</li></strong>
            <p> Of course  meat lovers pizza – or any pizza for that matter – isn’t pizza without cheese. You’ve got to have an ooey gooey base for all your toppings to meld into. As such, this pizza is loaded with about equal parts Canadian cheese and meats. It’s truly a feast for the meat – and cheese – lover in your life.
                 Hope you’re staying warm and cheesing it up!</p>
